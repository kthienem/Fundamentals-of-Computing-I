	The program is designed to compute the roots of a quadratic equation.
The user is asked to input the coeffiecients of their desired quadratic formula.
The program then uses these coefficients to compute the roots and displays them
to the user. If the roots are imaginary then the program displays an error
message explaining that it cannot compute non-real roots and then exits the
program.

	The program begins by displaying a meesage telling the user what the
program does. It then tells the user to input the coefficients of the desired
quadratic equation. The program prompts each of the three coefficients
seperately. After receiving the coefficients from the user it first checks that
the value underneath the square root to make sure that it is greater than or
equal to zero. If it is less than zero it diplays an error message saying that
the program cannot compute imaginary roots and exits the program. If the value
is greater than or equal to zero it calculates the two roots of the quadratic
equation and displays them to the user.

	The program was evaluated for correctness by checking the calculated
values against actually working out the the roots using the quadratic formula
By doing this I verified that it produced correct results. Values that produced
both real and imaginary roots were tested to see if the program properly
calculated the value underneath the radical to determine whether or not the
root will be real or imaginary. Before adding the if statement which checked
for imaginary roots, the program displayed imaginary roots as nan. After
seeing this I decided to add in the check for imaginary roots to prevent this 
from happening.
