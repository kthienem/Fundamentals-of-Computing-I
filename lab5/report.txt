User's Perspective:
This program begins by printing an explanantion of what it does and how you can
manipulate the rotation speed of the ferris wheel. The graphics window then
opens with a rotating circle of different colored hexagons. This rotation can be
sped up using the number keys on the keyboard.

Programmer's Perspective:
When the gfx window opens the program begins by drawing a white circle in the 
center of the screen. It then draws six different colored hexagons around the 
perimeter of the circle with equal angles inbetween each hexagon. The program
prints the hexagons by calling the drawPolygon function 6 times, each with a 
different input representing the position of the hexagon. The input into the 
function is used to determine where the center of the hexagon is located. The
dawPolygon function also calls the color function which changes the color of the
polygon depending on the input. The change in angle used to simulate animation
is defaulted to 0.01. This value can be changed using the number keys from
1 to 9. These keys change the value by multiplying the number by 0.01. The
program terminates when the user presses q.

Verification of correctness:
I verified that the program was correct by observing the it performed as
expected. There were no errors that would occur based on different keys the user
could press. One change I made in my program to prevent errors is that in my 
program I did not want the wheel to ever stop. Originally I had the user press
a and d to accelerate and decelerate the wheel respectively. When these inputs
were used there was an issue where if the user sped up the ferris wheel to a 
high rate and then rapidly decelerated it, they could make the ferris wheel stop.Because of this error I decided to change the input for change in rotational
speed.
